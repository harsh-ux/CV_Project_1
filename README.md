Title : Exploring the Impact of Traditional Computer Vision Transforms on Facial Classification Accuracy

Abstract : In recent years, facial classification technology has grown in popularity, with applications ranging from safety and surveillance to human-computer connection. However, most of the traditional face classification algorithms are sensitive to image changes such as scaling, rotation, and translation, which can affect the accuracy of facial classification systems. This study aims to investigate the effect of classic computer vision transformations on the precision of facial classification. We will evaluate the accuracy of numerous facial classification approaches, such as Haar wavelet transform, Discrete Cosine Transform, SIFT, HOG, and LBP, utilizing publicly accessible datasets like LFW and miniCelebA, in addition to a self-curated dataset. The curated dataset is named as Face-Platter with rich annotations on various attributes and images taken in varied lighting and camera conditions.
